Hotel Analytics Dashboard Demo

This is an interactive, single-page web application demonstrating a modern analytics dashboard for the hospitality industry. The project is built for a fictional Canadian hotel, "Aurora Peaks Hotel & Resort", and is presented as a demo by VisiVault Analytics Ltd.

The dashboard is built entirely with front-end technologies and leverages Google's Gemini API to generate real-time, AI-powered insights from the displayed data.
